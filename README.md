# XMRig-HTTP-API-Library
A python library for interacting with the XMRig HTTP api. 
Based on documentation for xmrig here: https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/api


## How to use
There is an example python script as an example on how to poll your node.   

Start xmrig with:   
`./xmrig --http-host=127.0.0.1 --http-port=1010 `

Currently available endpoints: 

"Summary"
"Backends"

Endpoints todo:  
"Config"
"JSON RPC"
Still need to add ability to access restricted api calls. Currently this helps with monitoring the current status of xmrig
